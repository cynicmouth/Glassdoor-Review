# Data Practice with Python

Hey all <br>

I'm utilzing this practice repo for me to practice some basic Python codes in data anaylsis.<br>
For this anaylsis, the data are scraped from Glassdoor with Apple's job reviews (~ 35k review). <br>

The current anaylsis will contain a list of followings: <br>
1. Data Cleaning 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis on reviews
3. N-Grams on Summary, Pros & Cons for all reviews

Future planned Implementation on this:
1. Topic Modeling using LDA
2. Tensorflow word2vec application
3. Predicting overall review star using tensorflow 

<br>
<br>
See finished Notebook here:<br>

1. [Glassdoor Review Exploratory Analysis][1] <br>
2. [Glassdoor Review Topic Modeling][2] <br>

Feel free to point out any improvement or share your thoughts on new ideas! <br>
<br>
Thanks for visiting :)
